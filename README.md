Experimental Android project
============================

This is my proof of concept project to demonstrate how to design Android 2.3.x application with the [MVC Passive View](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html) pattern and [annotations](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations). The main goal is a clean aplication design, enhance testability and reduce of boilerplate code.

It’s very simple application for fast sharing of text notes between Android and desktop through some sharing server with RESTful interface secured with OAuth2.

Originally it was created as a seminar work to school, but I didn’t have time to finish it yet. There is no documentation, comments or tests and some features are not completed. However I’ve shown it to @jnv few days ago, he liked it and told me that it’s better to publish it as it is then wait to some day when I’ll have a time to finish it. So there it is, hope somebody will incidentally find it.
